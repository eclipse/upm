This sensor handles the hard problem of combining various sensor information into a reliable measurement of sensor orientation (refered to as 'sensor fusion'). The onboard MCU runs this software and can provide fusion output in the form of Euler Angles, Quaternions, Linear Acceleration, and Gravity Vectors in 3 axes. The focus on this driver has been on supporting the fusion components. Less support is available for use of this device as a generic accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, however enough infrastructure is available to add any missing functionality. This device requires calibration in order to operate accurately. Methods are provided to retrieve calibration data (once calibrated) to be stored somewhere else, like in a file. A method is provided to load this data as well. Calibration data is lost on a power cycle. See one of the examples for a description of how to calibrate the device, but in essence: There is a calibration status register available (getCalibrationStatus()) that returns the calibration status of the accelerometer (ACC), magnetometer (MAG), gyroscope (GYR), and overall system (SYS). Each of these values range from 0 (uncalibrated) to 3 (fully calibrated). Calibration involves certain motions to get all 4 values at 3. The motions are as follows (though see the datasheet for more information): GYR: Simply let the sensor sit flat for a few seconds. ACC: Move the sensor in various positions. Start flat, then rotate slowly by 45 degrees, hold for a few seconds, then continue rotating another 45 degrees and hold, etc. 6 or more movements of this type may be required. You can move through any axis you desire, but make sure that the device is lying at least once perpendicular to the x, y, and z axis. MAG: Move slowly in a figure 8 pattern in the air, until the calibration values reaches 3. SYS: This will usually reach 3 when the other items have also reached 3. If not, continue slowly moving the device though various axes until it does.","Aliases":["bno055"],"Categories":["accelerometer","compass"],"Connections":["gpio","i2c"],"Project Type":["prototyping","industrial"],"Manufacturers":["adafruit"],"Kits":[],"Examples":{"Java":["BNO055_Example.java"],"Python":["bno055.py"],"Node.js":["bno055.js"],"C++":["bno055.cxx"],"C":["bno055.c"]},"Specifications":{"Vsource":{"unit":"v","low":2.4,"high":3.6},"Supply Current":{"unit":"mA","low":0.33,"high":12.3},"Supply Current (Suspended)":{"unit":"uA","typ":40},"Gyroscope Ranges":{"unit":"deg/s","low":125,"high":2000},"Magnetometer Ranges":{}},"Platforms":{"Intel Joule Module":{"Notes":["Requires pull-up resistors with carrier board"],"Images":[""]}},"Urls":{"Product Pages":["https://www.adafruit.com/products/2472"],"Datasheets":["https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/036/832/original/BST_BNO055_DS000_14.pdf"],"Schematics":["https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/024/546/medium800/sensors_BNO055_REV-C.png?1429569060"]}}}},{"Library":"button","Description":"Generic library for buttons & switches","Sensor Class":{"Button":{"Name":"Button","Description":"Basic UPM module for buttons and switches.

All 3 signals are provided by the device as analog 0-5Vdc, 0-10Vdc, or 4-20ma loop current outputs.  For devices supporting temperature, the valid temperature range is 10C to 50C.  The humidity ranges from 0% to 100% (non-condensing).  The CO2 sensor ranges from 0 to 2000 ppm. This driver was developed using the 5Vdc outputs and the 4-20ma outputs.  For voltage outputs, your MCU must be configured for 5V operation.  In addition, you must configure the sensor (via it's configuration switches) to output 0-5VDC only.  Using any other analog reference voltage will require the appropriate external circuitry (such as a voltage divider) in order to interface safely with your MCU. In addition, the sensor can be configured for 4-20ma usage, by specifying the correct receiver resistance (in ohms) in the constructor.  This sensor was tested with a Cooking Hacks (Libelium) 4-channel 4-20ma Arduino interface shield.  For this interface, the receiver resistance was specified as 165.0 ohms. For devices which do not support temperature, use '-1' as the temperature pin number in the object constructor.  If temperature measurement is disabled, getTemperature() will always return 0C/32F.

When the controller gets power, you will see the blue LED on board is on. 2) Put the pH electrode into the standard solution whose pH value is 7.00.  Run the dfrph example and note the pH output value.  Compare the value with 7.00, and calculate the difference.  This is the value you should supply to the setOffset() method. 3) Put the pH electrode into the pH standard solution whose value is 4.00. Then wait about one minute, and adjust the potentiometer on the interface board.  Let the value stabilise at around 4.00. At this time,the acidic calibration has been completed and you can measure the pH value of an acidic solution. 4) According to the linear characteristics of pH electrode itself, after the above calibration,you can directly measure the pH value of the alkaline solution. If you want to get better accuracy, you can recalibrate it. Alkaline calibration use the standard solution whose pH value is 9.18.  Also adjust the potentiometer and let the value stabilise at around 9.18.

An external power supply can be connected to provide more current if the need arises. It is recommended to use a series resistor with the GPIO/ADC pins when interfacing with other circuits. In output mode, GPIOs can source up to 8mA (gpio8-gpio15). So no additional circuitry is needed to drive regular LEDs. A 470 Ohms series resistor is recommended for current limiting when connecting an LED to a GPIO. In contrast to GPIOs, analog inputs can read voltages at any level between 0 to 3.3V volts. It is recommended to use a series resistor to protect the input from stray voltages and spikes. The internal Analog to Digital converter supports 10 bits resolution which is adequate for most applications.","Aliases":["nlgpio16","Numato 16 Channel USB GPIO Module With Analog Inputs"],"Categories":["other"],"Connections":["uart"],"Project Type":["prototyping"],"Manufacturers":["Numato Lab"],"Examples":{"Python":["nlgpio16.py"],"Node.js":["nlgpio16.js"],"C++":["nlgpio16.cxx"]},"Specifications":{"Vsource":{"unit":"V","usb":5},"Operating Temperature":{"unit":"°C","min":-40,"max":85},"Analog Inputs":{"unit":"inputs","inputs":7},"TTL Inputs":{"unit":"TTL 3.3V inputs","inputs":16},"ADC Resolution":{"unit":"bit","bits":10}},"Platforms":{"Intel Joule Module":{"Notes":["Might need pull up resistors"]},"Intel Edison":{"Notes":["Might need pull up resistors"]},"Arduino 101":{"Notes":["Might need pull up resistors"]}},"Urls":{"Product Pages":["https://numato.com/16-channel-usb-gpio-module-with-analog-inputs/"],"Datasheets":["https://docs.numato.com/doc/16-channel-usb-gpio-module-with-analog-inputs/"]}}}},{"Library":"nmea_gps","Description":"UPM C++ API for a generic GPS serial device reporting NMEA data","Sensor Class":{"NMEAGPS":{"Name":"API for the NMEA GPS Module","Description":"This is the UPM Module for a generic GPS serial device reporting NMEA data.

OpenZWave must be compiled and installed on your machine in order to use this library. This module was developed with OpenZWave 1.3/1.4, and an Aeon Z-Stick Gen5 configured as a Primary Controller. It provides the ability to query and set various values that can be used to control ZWave devices. It does not concern itself with configuration of devices. It is assumed that you have already setup your ZWave network using a tool like the OpenZWave control panel, and have already configured your devices as appropriate. To avoid exposing some of the internals of OpenZWave, devices (nodes) and their values, are accessed via a nodeId and a value index number. The ozwdump example will run dumpNodes() which will list the currently connected devices and the values that are available to them, along with an index number for that value. It is through these values (nodeId and index) that you can query and set device values at a low level. In addition to querying values from a device (such as state (on/off), or temperature, etc), methods are provided to allow you to control these devices to the extent they allow, for example, using a ZWave connected switch to turn on a lamp. Access to this class by OZW drivers is handled by the ozwInterface class. It is that class that drivers use for access to ozw, and therefore the Z-Wave network. This class is not intended to be used directly by end users. When writing an OZW driver, the ozwInterface class should be used (inherited) by your driver, and your driver should wrap and expose only those methods needed by the user.

Pressure data may be acquired at rates between 20 and 2000 samples per second over an SPI interface. It is intended for use with non-corrosive, non-ionic gases, such as air and other dry gases, designed and and RoHS compliant. Most of the functionality available on this chip has been implemented. The driver calculates the compensated pressure and temperature values based on the information provided in the datasheet. The user must not mess around with the coefficient and adc init value readings from the EEPROM as these are used to calculate the compensated pressure and temperature values. In order to get the sensor to work properly on an Edison, you would need to turn off the Edison SPI power management, this can be done with the command: echo on > /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:07.1/power/control.
