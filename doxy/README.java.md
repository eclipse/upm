UPM (Useful Packages & Modules) Sensor/Actuator repository for MRAA

UPM is a high level repository for sensors that use MRAA. Each sensor links
to MRAA and are not meant to be interlinked although some groups of sensors
may be. Each sensor contains a header which allows to interface with it.
Typically a sensor is represented as a class and instantiated.

The constructor is expected to initialise the sensor and parameters may be used
to provide identification/pin location on the board.

Typically an update() function will be called in order to get new data from the
sensor in order to reduce load when doing multiple reads to sensor data.

### Example

A sensor/actuator is expected to work as such (here is the servo ES08A API):
@snippet ES08ASample.java Interesting

However implementation and API design is completely up to the developer, some
enumerable sensors for example may provide much clever instantiation. Displays
may also create more complex structures in order to interface with them.

Browse through the list of all [examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/tree/master/examples/java).

Multi-sensor samples for the starter and specialized kits can be found in the
[iot-devkit-samples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-devkit-samples) repository.

### Supported Sensors

### Making your own UPM module

@ref porting link has more information on making new UPM modules.

There is also an example available for @ref max31855 sensor.

### Naming conventions and rules for new UPM contributions

Before you begin development, take a look at our @ref naming conventions.

Also, please read the guidelines for @ref contributions to UPM.

Don't forget to check the @ref documentation section.

Make sure you add yourself as an author on every new code file submitted.
If you are providing a fix with significant changes, feel free to add yourself
as a contributor. Signing-off your commits is mandatory.
