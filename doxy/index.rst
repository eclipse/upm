``Building UPM``
################

For building UPM, please follow this `link <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/building.md>`_.

``Examples``
############

Multi-sensor samples for the starter and specialized kits can be found in the `iot-devkit-samples <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-devkit-samples>`_
repository.

Individual sensor usage examples for Python are available `here <https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/tree/master/examples/python>`_.

``IDE Compatibility``
################

While there is no official IDE provided with our Python libraries, we do recommend the web-based IDE Wyliodrin. It can be used with multiple programming
languages, including Python. More information can be found on the Intel Developer Zone IDE page.
