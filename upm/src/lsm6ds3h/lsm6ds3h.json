            "Description": "The LSM6DS3H is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope performing at 1.1 mA (up to 1.6 kHz ODR) in high performance mode and enabling always-on low-power features for an optimal motion experience for the consumer. Not all functionality of this chip has been implemented in this driver, however all the pieces are present to add any desired functionality.  This driver supports both I2C (default) and SPI operation.",
