 * @brief API for the ES08A Servo
 * 
 * This module defines the ES08A interface for ES08A servos.
 * Like other servos, the ES08A servo has a shaft that can be controlled
 * by setting the desired angle. There are also routines for setting
 * and getting the minimum and maximum pulse width as well as the
 * maximum period.
