   * UPM module for the DS1307-based real-time clock. The clock can provide information
   * about seconds, minutes, hours, day of the week, day of the month,
   * month, and year. It can operate in either a 24-hour or a 12-hour format.
   * This device can also output a square wave at 1Khz, 4Khz, 8Khz, and 32Khz.
   * However, this capability is not implemented in this module.
