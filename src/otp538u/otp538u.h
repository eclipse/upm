   * @brief C++ API for the OTP538U IR Temperature Sensor
   *
   * UPM module for the OTP538U IR Temperature Sensor
   *
   * This module was tested with the Grove IR non-contact temperature
   * sensor.
   *
   * The sensor provides 2 analog outputs - one for the thermistor
   * that measures ambient temperature, and another for the thermopile
   * that measures object temperature.
   *
   * Much of the code depends on analyzing the SeeedStudio examples
   * and circuit design.  As a result, there are several 'magic'
   * numbers that were derived from their circuit design.  By default,
   * these values will be used.
   *
   * The tables used came from the datasheets "538U VT
   * Table__20_200(v1.3).pdf" and "538RT_table.pdf".
   *
   * These tables assume the object to be measured is 9cm (3.54
   * inches) from the sensor.
