            "Description": "The LIS2DS12 is an ultra-low-power high performance three-axis linear accelerometer belonging to the \"pico\" family which leverages on the robust and mature manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers. The LIS2DS12 has user-selectable full scales of 2g/4g/8g/16g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to 6400 Hz. Not all functionality of this chip has been implemented in this driver, however all the pieces are present to add any desired functionality.  This driver supports both I2C (default) and SPI operation.",
