 * an RGB backlight, such as a Grove RGB I2C LCD display
 *
 * JHD1313M1 has two I2C addreses: one belongs to a controller, very
 * similar to the upm::Lcm1602 LCD driver, that controls the
 * HD44780-based display, and the other controls only the
 * backlight. This module was tested with the Seeed Grove LCD RGB
 * Backlight v2.0 display that requires 5V to operate.
