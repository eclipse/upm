     * @brief UPM API for the BMI160 3-axis Accelerometer, Gyroscope and
     * Magnetometer
     *
     * The Bosch BMI160 is a 3-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope.
     * Additionally it supports an external Magnetometer, accessed
     * through the BMI160's register interface.  This driver was
     * developed with a BMI160 "Shuttle" board, which included a BMM150
     * Magnetometer.
     *
     * The device is driven by either 1.8v or 3.3vdc.  This driver
     * incorporates the Bosch BMI160 driver code at
     * https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMI160_driver
     *
     * The Bosch driver code does not provide a mechanism for passing
     * user data around (like the device context).  For this reason,
     * only one instance of this driver can be used in a given process,
     * due to the use of static data in the driver.
     *
     * While not all of the functionality of this device is supported
     * initially, the inclusion of the Bosch driver in the source code
     * makes it possible to support whatever features are required that
     * the driver can support.
