   * @brief API TCA9548A Multiplexer Breakout
   *
   * The TCA9548A device has eight bidirectional translating switches that can be
   * controlled through the I2C bus. The SCL/SDA upstream pair fans out to eight
   * downstream pairs, or channels. Any individual SCn/SDn channel or combination
   * of channels can be selected, determined by the contents of the programmable
   * control register.
   * The TCA9548A Multiplexer Breakout enables to get - up to 8 same-address I2C devices hooked up 
   * to one microcontroller - or up to 8 independent I2C buses. This multiplexer acts as a gatekeeper, 
   * shuttling the commands to the selected set of I2C pins with your command. The TCA9548A 
   * multiplexer is interesting in that it has an I2C address (0x70 by default) - and you basically 
   * send it a command to tell it which I2C multiplexed output you want to talk to, then you can 
   * address the board you want to address. You simply write a single byte with the desired multiplexed 
   * output number to that port, and bam - any future I2C packets will get sent to that port. 
   * The TCA9548A Multiplexer provides three pins (A0-A1-A2) that enable to change its address in
   * case 0x70 address is used by another sensor on the same bus. By connecting one of the Ax pin to Vin you 
   * change its value from 0 to 1, these values change the value of the three first bits of the address :
   * Address 0b01110-A2-A1-A0
   *    No wiring  A2=0 A1=0 A0=0  Address 0b01110000 0x70
   *    A0 wired   A2=0 A1=0 A0=1  Address 0b01110000 0x71
   *    A2 wired   A2=1 A1=0 A0=0  Address 0b01110100 0x74
   * Any address between 0x70 and 0x77 can be selected.
   *
   * Tested with Adafriut TCA9548A board.
