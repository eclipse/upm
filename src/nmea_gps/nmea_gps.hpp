   *
   * This driver was tested with a number of GPS devices that emit
   * NMEA data via a serial interface of some sort (typically a UART).
   *
   * The I2C capablity was tested with a UBLOX LEA-6H based GPS shield
   * from DFRobot.  Currently, the I2C capability is only supported
   * for UBLOX devices (or compatibles) that conform to the
   * specifications outlined in the u-blox6 Receiver Description
   * Protocol Specification, Chapter 4, DDC Port.
   *
   * An example using the UART.
   * @snippet nmea_gps.cxx Interesting
   * An example using I2C.
