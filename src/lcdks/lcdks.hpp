     * @brief API for the generic LCD Keypad Shield
     *
     * The LCD Keypad Shield uses 7 digital outputs and 1 analog input
     * (for the keypad). The outputs are used to drive an attached
     * LCM1602 LCD controller. This driver should be compatible with
     * the similar LCD keypad shields from Sainsmart, DFRobot and
     * Sparkfun.
