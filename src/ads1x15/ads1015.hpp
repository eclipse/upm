   * @brief API for ADS1015
   *
   * The ADS1013, ADS1014, and ADS1015 are precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with 12 bits of resolution
   * offered in an ultra-small, leadless QFN-10 package or an MSOP-10 package. The ADS1013/4/5 are designed with
   * precision, power, and ease of implementation in mind. The ADS1013/4/5 feature an onboard reference and oscillator.
   * Data is transferred via an I2C-compatible serial interface; four I2C slave addresses can be selected. The ADS1013/4/5
   * operate from a single power supply ranging from 2.0V to 5.5V.
   * The ADS1013/4/5 can perform conversions at rates up to 3300 samples per second (SPS). An onboard PGA is available
   * on the ADS1014 and ADS1015 that offers input ranges from the supply to as low as +/- 256mV, allowing both large and small
   * signals to be measured with high resolution. The ADS1015 also features an input multiplexer (MUX) that provides two
   * differential or four single-ended inputs.
   * The ADS1013/4/5 operate either in continuous conversion mode or a single-shot mode that automatically powers down
   * after a conversion and greatly reduces current consumption during idle periods. The ADS1013/4/5 are specified from
   * -40 deg C to +125 deg C.
   *
   * Tested with Adafriut ADS1015 board: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1083
