 * An LED is a p-n junction semiconductor which emits light in
 * response to voltage. The longer wire of an LED connects
 * to the positive seat (anode); the shorter wire connects to the
 * negative seat (cathode). The flat side of the bulb corresponds
 * to the cathode, while the rounded side corresponds to the anode.
