/**

 *
 * Measurement Specialties [HTU21D]
 * (http://www.meas-spec.com/downloads/HTU21D.pdf)
 * is a digital humidity sensor with temperature output.
 * RH will report between 0 and 100% and temperature range is
 * -40 to +125 degC.  Note that the getCompRH is the preferred
 * function below (passing true to cause a measurement cycle).  If
 * the actual values used for the compensated ready are necessary, use
 * the getHumidity(false) and getTemperature(false) functions following
 * the getCompRH call.
 * Also note that the sensor should not perform more than a couple of
 * measurements per second to limit the heating of the sensor.
