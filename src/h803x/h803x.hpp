   * @brief UPM API for the Veris H803X Energy Meter
   *
   * This module implements support for the Veris H8035 and H8036
   * Energy Meters.
   *
   * The H8036 is similar to the H8035, but provides much more data.
   *
   * The Enercept H8035/H8036 is an innovative three-phase networked
   * (Modbus RTU) power transducer that combines electronics and high
   * accuracy industrial grade CTs in a single package. The need for
   * external electrical enclosures is eliminated, greatly reducing
   * installation time and cost. Color-coordination between voltage
   * leads and CTs makes phase matching easy. Additionally, these
   * transducers automatically detect and compensate for phase
   * reversal, eliminating the concern of CT load orientation. Up to
   * 63 Transducers can be daisy-chained on a single RS-485 network.
   *
   * This module was developed using libmodbus 3.1.2, and the H8035.
   * The H8036 has not been tested.  libmodbus 3.1.2 must be present
   * for this module to build.
   *
   * It was developed using an RS232->RS485 interface.  You cannot use
   * the built in MCU TTL UART pins for accessing this device -- you
   * must use a full Serial RS232->RS485 or USB-RS485 interface
   * connected via USB.
   *
