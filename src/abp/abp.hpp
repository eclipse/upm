 * @brief API for the ABP Honeywell Pressure Sensor
 *
 * This is the UPM Module for the ABP Honeywell Pressure and Temp
 * sensor. This sensor uses an onboard ASIC to output values
 * of pressure that are updated at approximately 2 KHz. It is capable
 * of detecting pressure in the 0-5 psi range and it has an i2c
 * based interface. Temperature calculation using this driver is possible
 * but not all ABP sensors support that functionality.
 *
 * NOTE: This driver supports only the I2C based ABP sensors, it does
 * not currently support SPI and Analog based sensors.
