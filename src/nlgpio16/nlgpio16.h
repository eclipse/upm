     * @brief API for the NLGPIO16 16 channel USB GPIO Module
     *
     * The NLGPIO16 is a USB adapter providing access to 16 GPIO's, 7
     * of which can be used as analog inputs.  The GPIO's are 3.3v
     * only.  An external power supply can be connected to provide
     * more current if the need arises.
     *
     * It is recommended to use a series resistor with the GPIO/ADC
     * pins when interfacing with other circuits. In output mode,
     * GPIOs can source up to 8mA (gpio8-gpio15). So no additional
     * circuitry is needed to drive regular LEDs. A 470 Ohms series
     * resistor is recommended for current limiting when connecting an
     * LED to a GPIO. In contrast to GPIOs, analog inputs can read
     * voltages at any level between 0 to 3.3V volts. It is
     * recommended to use a series resistor to protect the input from
     * stray voltages and spikes. The internal Analog to Digital
     * converter supports 10 bits resolution which is adequate for
     * most applications.
     *
     * Maximum IO source/sink current on GPIO 0-7 is 2mA
     * Maximum IO source/sink current on GPIO 8-15 is 8mA
     *
