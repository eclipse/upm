     * @brief API for the Grove Rotary Encoder
     *
     * UPM module for the Grove rotary encoder. This rotary encoder
     * encodes a rotation signal into electronic pulses that can be used
     * to measure rotation and direction. It is useful in cases where a
     * rotary knob is required, but using a potentiometer is not
     * desirable. A rotary encoder can turn a full 360 degrees
     * without a stop and does not place a resistive load on the
     * circuit, as is the case with a potentiometer.
     *
     * This module maintains a position that is incremented or
     * decremented according to the rotation on the encoder.
