   * @brief C++ API for the RPR220 based Grove IR Reflective Sensor. 
   *
   * UPM module for the Grove IR Reflective Sensor.  The sensitivity
   * can be adjusted with the potentiometer on the sensor module.  It
   * has a range of approximately 15mm, and a fast response time.
   *
   * It detects high contrast dark areas on a light background.
   *
   * This module allows the user to determine the current status
   * (black detected or not).  Additionally, if desired, an Interrupt
   * Service Routine (ISR) can be installed that will be called when
   * black is detected.  Either method can be used, depending on your
   * use case.
