     * @brief API for the DS18B20 1-Wire Temperature Sensor
     *
     * This driver supports, and was tested with, a DS18B20 with
     * external power.
     *
     * Multiple DS18B20 devices can be connected to this bus.  This
     * module will identify all such devices connected, and allow you
     * to access them using an index starting at 0.
     *
     * Parasitic power is not currently supported due
     * to the very tight 10us limit on switching a GPIO properly to
     * supply power during certain operations.  For this reason, you
     * should use external power for your sensors.
     *
     * Setting the alarm values (Tl, Th) is also not supported, since
     * this is only useful when doing a 1-wire device search looking
     * for devices in an alarm state, a capability not yet supported
     * in MRAA.  In reality, this is trivial to handle yourself in
     * your application.
     *
     * This device requires the use of a UART to provide access to a
     * Dallas 1-wire bus, via a new facility supported by MRAA (once
     * the relevant PR is accepted), using the UartOW access class.
     * It is important to realize that the UART is only being used to
     * access and control a Dallas 1-wire compliant bus, it is not
     * actually a UART device.
     *
