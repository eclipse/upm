     * @brief API for the DS18B20 1-Wire Temperature Sensor
     *
     * This driver supports, and was tested with, a DS18B20 with
     * external power.
     *
     * Multiple DS18B20 devices can be connected to this bus.  This
     * module will identify all such devices connected, and allow you
     * to access them using an index starting at 0.
     *
     * Parasitic power is not currently supported due
     * to the very tight 10us limit on switching a GPIO properly to
     * supply power during certain operations.  For this reason, you
     * should use external power for your sensors.
     *
     * Setting the alarm values (Tl, Th) is also not supported, since
     * this is only useful when doing a 1-wire device search looking
     * for devices in an alarm state, a capability not yet supported
     * in MRAA.  In reality, this is trivial to handle yourself in
     * your application.
     *
     * This device requires the use of a TTL level UART (specifically
     * through the UartOW MRAA context class) to provide access to a
     * Dallas 1-wire bus. It is important to realize that the UART is
     * only being used to provide an interface to devices on a Dallas
     * 1-wire compliant bus.
     *
     * A circuit like the following should be used for the UART
     * interface (ASCII schematic - best viewed in a fixed monospace
     * font):
     *
     * -|
     * U|      (D1)
     * A| TX---|<--+
     * R|          |
     * T| RX-------o--------o  >to 1-wire data bus
     * -|
     *
     *
     *             Vcc
     *              |
     *              o------------+
     *              |            |
     *              R1           |
     *              |            o(+)
     * >1-wire------o--------o[DS18B20]
     *                           o(-)
     *                           |
     *                          GND
     *
     * D1 = 1N4148
     * R1 = 4.7K
     *
     * The cathode of D1 is connected to the UART TX.
