   *
   * This sensor family returns an analog voltage corresponding to the
   * distance of an object from the sensor in inches.  It has a
   * resolution of about 9.7 millivolts per inch with a 5.0 AREF.  The
   * differences between the various versions (EZ1, EZ2, etc) are
   * related to the narrowness of the beam angle.
   *
   * This class supports these sensors with an analog input only.
   *
   * This driver was developed using an LV-MaxSonar-EZ3.
