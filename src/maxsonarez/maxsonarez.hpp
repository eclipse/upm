   * @brief API for the LV-MaxSonar-EZ Family of Ultrasonic Rangers
   *
   * Sensors of this family return an analog voltage corresponding to the
   * distance of an object from the sensor in inches. They have a
   * resolution of about 9.7 millivolts per inch with an analog reference voltage of 5.0 V. The
   * differences between various versions (EZ1, EZ2, etc.) are
   * related to the narrowness of the beam angle.
   *
   * This class supports these sensors with an analog input only.
   *
   * This driver was developed using an LV-MaxSonar-EZ3 ultrasonic ranger.
