 * @brief API for the Grove Temperature Sensor
 *
 * Basic UPM module for the Grove temperature sensor on analog. This sensor
 * uses a thermistor to measure ambient temperature. The conversion formula has
 * been updated to work with versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the sensor. For the older
 * v1.0 sensor you will have to specify R0 and B values when initializing the
 * device. The range of this sensor is -40 to 125 C and accuracy is +/- 1.5 C.
