 * @brief API for the Grove Light Sensor
 *
 * The Grove light sensor detects the intensity of the ambient light.
 * As the light intensity of the environment increases, the resistance
 * of the sensor decreases. This means the raw value from the
 * analog pin is larger in bright light and smaller in the dark.
 * An approximate lux value can also be returned.
