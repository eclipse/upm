     *
     * @brief API for the BNO055 Absolute Orientation 9DOF Fusion Hub
     *
     * The BNO055 is a System in Package (SiP), integrating a triaxial
     * 14-bit accelerometer, a triaxial 16-bit gyroscope with a range of
     * +/- 2000 degrees per second, a triaxial geomagnetic sensor and a
     * 32-bit cortex M0+ microcontroller running Bosch Sensortec sensor
     * fusion software, in a single package.
     *
     * This sensor handles the hard problem of combining various sensor
     * information into a reliable measurement of sensor orientation
     * (refered to as 'sensor fusion').  The onboard MCU runs this
     * software and can provide fusion output in the form of Euler
     * Angles, Quaternions, Linear Acceleration, and Gravity Vectors in
     * 3 axes.
     *
     * The focus on this driver has been on supporting the fusion
     * components.  Less support is available for use of this device as
     * a generic accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, however
     * enough infrastructure is available to add any missing
     * functionality.
     *
     * This device requires calibration in order to operate accurately.
     * Methods are provided to retrieve calibration data (once
     * calibrated) to be stored somewhere else, like in a file.  A
     * method is provided to load this data as well.  Calibration data
     * is lost on a power cycle.  See one of the examples for a
     * description of how to calibrate the device, but in essence:
     *
     * There is a calibration status register available
     * (getCalibrationStatus()) that returns the calibration status of
     * the accelerometer (ACC), magnetometer (MAG), gyroscope (GYR), and
     * overall system (SYS).  Each of these values range from 0
     * (uncalibrated) to 3 (fully calibrated).  Calibration involves
     * certain motions to get all 4 values at 3.  The motions are as
     * follows (though see the datasheet for more information):
     *
     * GYR: Simply let the sensor sit flat for a few seconds.
     *
     * ACC: Move the sensor in various positions.  Start flat, then
     * rotate slowly by 45 degrees, hold for a few seconds, then
     * continue rotating another 45 degrees and hold, etc.  6 or more
     * movements of this type may be required.  You can move through any
     * axis you desire, but make sure that the device is lying at least
     * once perpendicular to the x, y, and z axis.
     *
     * MAG: Move slowly in a figure 8 pattern in the air, until the
     * calibration values reaches 3.
     *
     * SYS: This will usually reach 3 when the other items have also
     * reached 3.  If not, continue slowly moving the device though
     * various axes until it does.
