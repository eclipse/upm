            "Description": "The driver was developed using the CWLSHTA CO2 Gas sensor.  The 'T' variant supports a temperature transmitter, and the 'H' variant supports a humidity sensor.  All 3 signals are provided by the device as analog 0-5Vdc, 0-10Vdc, or 4-20ma loop current outputs.  For devices supporting temperature, the valid temperature range is 10C to 50C.  The humidity ranges from 0% to 100% (non-condensing).  The CO2 sensor ranges from 0 to 2000 ppm. This driver was developed using the 5Vdc outputs and the 4-20ma outputs.  For voltage outputs, your MCU must be configured for 5V operation.  In addition, you must configure the sensor (via it's configuration switches) to output 0-5VDC only.  Using any other analog reference voltage will require the appropriate external circuitry (such as a voltage divider) in order to interface safely with your MCU. In addition, the sensor can be configured for 4-20ma usage, by specifying the correct receiver resistance (in ohms) in the constructor.  This sensor was tested with a Cooking Hacks (Libelium) 4-channel 4-20ma Arduino interface shield.  For this interface, the receiver resistance was specified as 165.0 ohms. For devices which do not support temperature, use '-1' as the temperature pin number in the object constructor.  If temperature measurement is disabled, getTemperature() will always return 0C/32F. For devices which do not support humidity, use '-1' as the temperature pin number in the object constructor.  If humidity measurement is disabled, getHumidity() will always return 0.",
