 * @brief C++ API for Jhd1313m1 i2c controller for HD44780 based displays with
 * an RGB backlight such as the Grove RGB i2c LCD display
 *
 * The Jhd1313m1 has two i2c addreses, one belongs to a controller very similar
 * to the upm::Lcm1602 LCD driver which controls the HD44780 based display and the
 * other controls solely the backlight. This module was tested with the Seed
 * [Grove LCD RGB Backlight v2.0 display]
 * (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-LCD-RGB-Backlight-p-1643.html?cPath=34_36),
 * which requires 5V to operate.
