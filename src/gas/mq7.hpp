   * @brief API for the MQ7 CO Gas Sensor
   *
   * The Grove MQ7 Gas Sensor module is useful for detecting Carbon
   * Monoxide (CO) concentrations in the air.  It has a detection
   * range of 20-2000 ppm.
   *
   * For optimum use, it requires calibration after a pre-heat time of
   * 48 hours.  See the datasheet for details.
