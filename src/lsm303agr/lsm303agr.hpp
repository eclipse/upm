     *
     * The LSM303AGR is an ultra-low-power high-performance
     * system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear acceleration
     * sensor and a 3D digital magnetic sensor.  The LSM303AGR has
     * linear acceleration full scales of 2g/4g/8g/16g and a
     * magnetic field dynamic range of 50 Gauss.
     *
     * Not all functionality of this chip has been implemented in this
     * driver, however all the pieces are present to add any desired
     * functionality.  This driver supports only I2C operation.
     *
     * This device requires 3.3v operation.
