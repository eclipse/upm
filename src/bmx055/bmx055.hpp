   * @brief API for the BMX055 9-axis Sensor Module
   *
   * The BMX055 is an integrated 9-axis sensor for the detection of
   * movements and rotations and magnetic heading. It comprises the
   * full functionality of a triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor, a
   * triaxial angular rate sensor and a triaxial geomagnetic sensor.
   *
   * The BMX055 senses orientation, tilt, motion, acceleration,
   * rotation, shock, vibration and heading in cell phones, handhelds,
   * computer peripherals, man-machine interfaces, virtual reality
   * features and game controllers.
   *
   * The BMX055 is essentially 3 separate devices in one: the BMA250E
   * Accelerometer, the BMG160 Gyroscope, and the BMM150 Magnetometer.
   * They are completely independent of each other.
   *
   * This driver provides a very simple interface to these 3 devices.
   * If finer control is desired, you should just use the separate
   * BMA250E, BMG160, and BMM150 device classes directly.  This driver
   * simply initializes all three devices, and provides a mechanism to
   * read accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data from them.
