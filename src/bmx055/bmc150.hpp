     * @brief API for the BMC150 6-axis eCompass
     *
     *
     * The BMC150 is an integrated electronic compass solution for
     * consumer market applications. It comprises a 12bit leading edge
     * triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor and an ultra-low power, high
     * precision triaxial magnetic field sensor. It allows measurements
     * of acceleration and magnetic field in three perpendicular
     * axes. Performance and features of both sensing technologies are
     * carefully tuned and perfectly match the demanding requirements of
     * all 6-axis mobile applications such as electronic compass,
     * navigation or augmented reality.

     * The BMC150 is essentially 2 separate devices in one: the BMA250E
     * Accelerometer and the BMM150 Magnetometer.  They are completely
     * independent of each other.
     *
     * This driver provides a very simple interface to these 2 devices.
     * If finer control is desired, you should just use the separate
     * BMA25E and BMM150 device classes directly.  This driver simply
     * initializes both devices, and provides a mechanism to read
     * accelerometer and magnetometer data from them.
     *
