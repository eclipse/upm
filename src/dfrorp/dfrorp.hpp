   * @brief API for the DFRobot ORP (Oxidation/Reduction Potential) Sensor
   *
   * This library was tested with the DFRobot ORP (Oxidation/Reduction
   * Potential) Sensor.
   *
   * To calibrate:
   *
   * Disconnect the sensor probe (but leave the sensor interface board
   * connected).  Then run one of the examples while holding down the
   * 'calibrate' button on the device.  Read the ORP value reported
   * (it should be fairly small).
   *
   * This value is what you should supply to
   * setCalibrationOffset().  Then reconnect the probe to the
   * interface board and you should be ready to go.
   *
   * DO NOT press the calibrate button on the interface board while
   * the probe is attached or you can permanently damage the probe.
   *
