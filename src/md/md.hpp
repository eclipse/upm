     * @brief API for the I2C Motor Driver
     *
     * This class implements support for the I2C Motor Driver.
     * This device can support a single 4-wire stepper motor, or two
     * 2-wire DC motors. The device contains an Atmel* ATmega8L
     * microcontroller that manages an L298N H-bridge driver chip.
     *
     * This device supports an I2C bus speed of 100Khz only.
     *
     * The module does not provide any telemetry or status - it only
     * accepts I2C commands for its various operations.
     *
     * This module was tested with version 1.3 of the I2C Motor
     * Driver.
     *
     * For stepper operation, this driver can run in one of two modes -
     * Mode 1, where this driver handles the stepping operation, and
     * Mode 2, where this driver simply sends commands to the
     * Motor Driver, and it handles the stepping operation.  Mode2
     * requires updated (and working) firmware to be loaded onto the
     * device.
     *
     * The default stepper operation mode is Mode1, which is generally
     * more flexible and is supported on all firmware revisions.
     *
