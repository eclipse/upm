     * @brief API for the DFRobot URM37 Ultrasonic Ranger
     *
     * The driver was tested with the DFRobot URM37 Ultrasonic Ranger,
     * V4.  It has a range of between 5 and 500 centimeters (cm).  It
     * supports both analog distance measurement, and UART based
     * temperature and distance measurements.  This driver does not
     * support PWM measurement mode.
     *
     * For UART operation, the only supported baud rate is 9600.  In
     * addition, you must ensure that the UART TX/RX pins are
     * configured for TTL operation (the factory default) rather than
     * RS232 operation, or permanent damage to your URM37 and/or MCU
     * will result.  On power up, the LED indicator will blink one
     * long pulse, followed by one short pulse to indicate TTL
     * operation.  See the DFRobot wiki for more information:
     *
