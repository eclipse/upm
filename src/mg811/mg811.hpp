   * @brief API for the DFRobot CO2 Sensor
   *
   * This sensor returns an an analog voltage that falls as the
   * concentration of CO2 increases.  It contains a heater that must
   * be allowed to 'warm' up the sensor before measurements are stable
   * (hours to days is the recommendation).  It requires that the MCU
   * be powered from an external power supply (not USB) at 5v, since
   * the heater will consume significant current.
   *
   * The sensor should be allowed to 'heat' up for some time before
   * beginning use, typically a couple of hours minimum.  It also
   * needs fairly precise calibration at 400ppm and 1000ppm to return
   * meaningful results.
   *
   * The sensor also incorporates a potentiometer that can be adjusted
   * to specific threshold.  Once that threshold is reached, an LED
   * on the sensor will light, and the digital pin will be driven
   * high.
   *
