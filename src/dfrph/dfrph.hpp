   * @brief API for the DFRobot pH Sensors
   *
   * This sensor family returns an analog voltage proportional to the
   * acidity or alkalinity of a liquid -- it's pH value.
   *
   * This driver was developed using the DFRobot Analog pH meter and
   * the DFRobot Analog pH Meter Pro.
   *
   *
   * Calibration instructions, taken and slightly reworded from the
   *  DFRobot wiki at:
   *  http://dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/PH_meter%28SKU:_SEN0161%29
   *
   *  1) Connect equipment: the pH electrode is connected to the BNC
   *  connector on the pH meter board, and then the pH meter board is
   *  connected to the analog port 0 of the controller. When the
   *  controller gets power, you will see the blue LED on board is on.
   *
   *  2) Put the pH electrode into the standard solution whose pH
   *  value is 7.00.  Run the dfrph example and note the pH output
   *  value.  Compare the value with 7.00, and calculate the
   *  difference.  This is the value you should supply to the
   *  setOffset() method.
   *
   *  3) Put the pH electrode into the pH standard solution whose
   *  value is 4.00. Then wait about one minute, and adjust the
   *  potentiometer on the interface board.  Let the value stabilise
   *  at around 4.00. At this time,the acidic calibration has been
   *  completed and you can measure the pH value of an acidic
   *  solution.
   *
   *  4) According to the linear characteristics of pH electrode
   *  itself, after the above calibration,you can directly measure the
   *  pH value of the alkaline solution. If you want to get better
   *  accuracy, you can recalibrate it. Alkaline calibration use the
   *  standard solution whose pH value is 9.18.  Also adjust the
   *  potentiometer and let the value stabilise at around 9.18. After
   *  this calibration, you can measure the pH value of an alkaline
   *  solution.
