   * @brief UPM API for the Veris E50HX Energy Meter
   *
   * This module implements support for the Veris E50H2 and E50H5
   * BACnet Energy Meters.
   *
   * From the datasheet: The E50H5 BACnet MS/TP DIN Rail Meter with
   * Data Logging combines exceptional performance and easy
   * installation to deliver a cost-effective solution for power
   * monitoring applications. Native serial communication via BACnet
   * MS/TP provides complete accessibility of all measurements to your
   * Building Automation System The data logging capability protects
   * data in the event of a power failure. The E50H5 can be easily
   * installed on standard DIN rail, surface mounted or contained in
   * an optional NEMA 4 enclosure, as needed. The front-panel LCD
   * display makes device installation and setup easy and provides
   * local access to the full set of detailed measurements.
   *
   * This module was developed using the upm::BACNETMSTP module, based
   * on libbacnet-stack 0.8.3.  Both libbacnet 0.8.3 and the
   * upm::BACNETMSTP libraries must be present in order to build this
   * module.  This driver was developed on the E50H5.  The Trend Log
   * functionality is not currently supported.
   *
   * The Binary Input Objects are also not supported as these are only
   * used for the Alarm bits which are already available from Analog
   * Input Object 52 as an alarm bitfield incorporating all of the
   * supported alarm indicators.
   *
   * It was connected using an RS232->RS485 interface.  You cannot use
   * the built in MCU TTL UART pins for accessing this device -- you
   * must use a full Serial RS232->RS485 or USB-RS485 interface
   * connected via USB.
