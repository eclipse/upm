            "Description": "This is the UPM Module for the Video Capture driver. This UPM module captures a still frame from a Linux V4L device, such as a USB webcam, and and then allows you to save it as a JPEG image into a file. The camera and driver in use must support streaming, mmap-able buffers and must provide data in YUYV format.  This should encompass most video cameras out there.  It has been tested with a few off the shelf cameras without any problems.",
